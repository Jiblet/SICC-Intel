# SICC_Intel
A small mod that enables both Intelligence folders and the new (as of 12.12) Keycard holder cases to be stored inside a S I C C organizational pouch.

It might be a little OP and it certainly makes the docs case redundant as soon as you can afford a SICC, but constantly switching between them depending on whether I was going Customs/Reserve, and so was likely to find Intel, was getting annoying.
